A simple database for a simple carshop.

## Installing and running
Go to the root folder and run `npm run install-and-run` to install and run the entire project. Alternatively, if running two processes in the same terminal feels like a bad idea, you could instead go to the root folder and `/client`, and run `npm install && npm start` in both folders separately.
